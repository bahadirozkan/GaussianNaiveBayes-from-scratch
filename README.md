# Gaussian Naive Bayes from scratch with Python

Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm was applied to the [abalone data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone) for the classification of the age group (1: Young, 2: Middle-aged and 3: Old). This implementation gives the same result as the *sklearn* built-in GaussianNB(). Output is the heatmaps of the different train and test distributions using 3 and all features.

### How to run:
```console
$ python naiveBayes.py
```
### Sample Output:
![Sample Output](Heatmaps/Trn%208fTrain1000ValRest.png)

### Further Work:
Evaluation of the results for each case
